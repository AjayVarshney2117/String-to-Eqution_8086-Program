# String-to-Eqution_8086-Program

Consider a paragraph of 100 characters at maximum. We need to extract the numeric 
values from this paragraph (between 0-9) that are written as text and then perform the needed 
arithmetic operation between them. The operation should be indicated in the text which could 
be (add only). The result of the operation should be printed in the center of the 
screen with the ability to move it to the left, right, up, and down according to the movement 
of arrows. 
To clarify things, consider the following input paragraph:

We have the numbers one, two, and three, please do add operation on them.

The output of the program should be as following:
           
           
           1+2+3=6
